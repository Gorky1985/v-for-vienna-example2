              Vienna is the capital, largest city, and one of nine provinces of
              Austria. Vienna is Austria's most populous city and its primate
              city, with about two million inhabitants (2.9 million within the
              metropolitan area, nearly one third of the country's population),
              and its cultural, economic, and political center. It is the
              6th-largest city proper by population in the European Union and
              the largest of all cities on the Danube river.

                The Vienna State Opera is an opera house and opera company based
                in Vienna, Austria. The 1,709-seat Renaissance Revival venue was
                the first major building on the Vienna Ring Road. The opera
                house was inaugurated as the "Vienna Court Opera" (Wiener
                Hofoper) in the presence of Emperor Franz Joseph I and Empress
                Elisabeth of Austria.

                A fiacre is a form of hackney coach, a horse-drawn four-wheeled
                carriage for hire. In Vienna such cabs are called Fiaker and
                still survive in Vienna and other European travel centres as
                tourist attractions.

                Schwedenplatz is located in Vienna's 1st district, Inner City,

                important public transport hubs in Vienna. Schwedenbrücke and
                Schwedenplatz were given their current names in gratitude for
                Sweden's help after the First World War, which benefited the
                children of Vienna in particular.

          <p>
            For the second year in a row, Vienna has been named the most livable
            city in the world. The Austrian capital earned the top spot on the
            Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) annual ranking because of its
            stability, its robust health care and education systems and its
            strong infrastructure, among other factors.

          <p>
            The Donauinselfest is a free open-air music festival which occurs
            annually at Donauinsel in Vienna, Austria. The festival is hosted by
            SPÖ Wien. It is the largest open-air music festival in the world,

          <p>
            In Vienna, the Danube is omnipresent, whether in the form of the
            Donau-Auen National Park or Old Danube, Danube Island or Danube
            Canal. This also means that the river banks and beaches are close
            by. The Viennese use it for recreation, games and sports or for
            pleasurable hours in the beach cafés, bars and restaurants on the
            Old Danube, as well as Copa Beach and Sunken City on Danube Island.
